# spring-bloom-dynamics
This repository contains the Python 3 scripts for estimating climate change induced uncertainties in phytoplankton spring bloom dynamics.  The scripts cover data processing of chlorophyll-a concnetrations (in-situ from Rijkswaterstaat, satellite from CMEMS, fused data from https://github.com/fmeulen/DataFusion), air temperature and solar radiation (in-situ from KNMI, climate projections from Euro-CORDEX, synthetic climate prjections from Meszaros et al .(2020)). The scripts also include time series forecasting using Facebook's Prophet model. Moreover the scripts include concave regression to extract cardinal dates of phytoplanton spring blooms.
